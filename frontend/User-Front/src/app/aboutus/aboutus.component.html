                    <p>The company was founded in 1998, spurred by what Velos called his "initiating framework", which

                        as an initiate to participate in the internet business boom that time. In 1998 Velos left his
                        employment as the president
                        of Ofcol & Co. and moved to Seattle. He began to work on a business plan for what would
                        eventualy become Purple Orchid.</p>
